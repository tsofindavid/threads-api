The Threads Insights API allows you to read the insights from users&#039; own Threads.

### Permissions

The Threads Insights API requires an appropriate access token and permissions based on the node you are targeting. While you are testing, you can easily generate tokens and grant your app permissions by using the Graph API Explorer.

* `threads_basic` — Required for making any calls to all Threads API endpoints.
* `threads_manage_insights` — Required for making `GET` calls to insights endpoints.

### Limitations

* The user insights `since` and `until` parameters do not work for dates before April 13, 2024 (Unix timestamp `1712991600`).

## Media Insights

To retrieve the available insights metrics, send a `GET` request to the `/&#123;threads-media-id&#125;/insights` endpoint with the `metric` parameter containing a comma-separated list of metrics to be returned.

**Note:**

* Returned metrics do not capture nested replies&#039; metrics.
* An empty array will be returned for `REPOST_FACADE` posts because they are posts made by other users.

### Available Metrics

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `views` | The number of times your post was played or displayed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Note:** This metric is [in development](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/metrics-labeling). |
| `likes` | The number of likes on the post. |
| `replies` | The number of replies on the post.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Note:** When the requested media is a root post, this number includes total replies. If the media is itself a reply, this number includes only **direct** replies. |
