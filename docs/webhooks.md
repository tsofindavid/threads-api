Webhooks for Threads allow you to receive real-time notifications for the subscribed topics and fields.

## Receive Live Webhook Notifications

To receive live webhook notifications, the following conditions must be satisfied:

- Your app must have Threads webhooks added as a sub-use case and appropriate fields subscribed to in the App Dashboard.

- For non-tech providers, the apps must be in [Live Mode](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/development/build-and-test/app-modes).

- For tech providers, the apps must have permissions with an [Advanced Access level](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview/access-levels). You can request Advanced Access for permissions as shown here:

If the app permissions don&#039;t have an access level of Advanced Access, the app won&#039;t receive webhook notifications.

- The app user must have granted your app appropriate permissions (i.e., `threads_basic`, `threads_read_replies` for reply webhooks).

- The business connected to the app must be verified.

- To receive real-time [reply](#real-time-reply-notifications) and [mention](#real-time-mention-notifications) notifications, the owner of the media object upon which the webhook event occurs must not have set their account to private.

- To receive real-time [delete](#real-time-delete-notifications) and [publish](#real-time-publish-notifications) notifications, the owner of the media object upon which the webhook event occurs must be a public account or private account that authenticated to the app.

### Limitations

* Apps don&#039;t receive webhook notifications if the media where the reply or mention appears was created by a private account.
* Your app must have successfully completed App Review ([Advanced Access](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview/access-levels)) to receive webhooks notifications for all of the fields.

### Step 0: [Optional] Use the sample app to test your integration

Download the [webhooks sample app](https://github.com/fbsamples/graph-api-webhooks-samples/) to test your integration.

### Step 1: Add the webhooks sub-use case to the main Threads API use case

Under **Use Cases** &gt; **Customize** &gt; **Settings**, add the **Get real-time notifications with Threads Webhooks** sub-use case.

### Step 2: Create an endpoint and configure Threads webhooks

[Create an endpoint](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/webhooks/getting-started) that accepts and processes webhooks. To add the configuration:

1. Select the desired topic, and click **Subscribe to this object**.
2. Set the callback URL and token.

The token here is passed to your server defined in the callback URL to allow verification that the call originates from Meta servers.

#### Webhook Topics

##### Moderate topic fields

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `replies` | [Replies](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/threads/retrieve-and-manage-replies/replies-and-conversations#a-thread-s-replies) on a [Threads Media](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/threads/retrieve-and-discover-posts/retrieve-posts) owned by the Threads install user.  &lt;br&gt;**Required permission(s):** [`threads_basic`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions#threads_basic), [`threads_read_replies`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions#threads_read_replies) |
| `delete` | Threads posts that were [deleted](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/threads/posts/delete-posts) by the authenticated user.  &lt;br&gt;**Required permissions:** [`threads_basic`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions#threads_basic), [`threads_delete`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions#threads_delete) |

##### Interaction topic fields
