You may use the Threads API to enable people to create and publish content on a person’s behalf on Threads, and to display those posts within your app solely to the person who created it.

**Warning:** The Threads API can be accessed by either `graph.threads.com` or `graph.threads.net`.

## Rate Limiting

Calls to the Threads API are counted against the calling app&#039;s call count. An app&#039;s call count is unique for each app and app user pair and is the number of calls the app has made in a rolling 24-hour window. It is calculated as follows:

`Calls within 24 hours = 4800 * Number of Impressions`

The Number of Impressions is the number of times any content from the app user&#039;s Threads account has entered a person&#039;s screen within the last 24 hours.

Rate limiting may also be subject to total CPU time per day:

`720000 * number_of_impressions for total_cputime 

2880000 * Number of Impressions for total_time`

**Note:** The minimum value for impressions is 10 (so if the impressions is less than 10 we default to 10).


### Posts

Threads profiles are limited to 250 API-published posts within a 24-hour moving period. Carousels count as a single post. This limit is enforced on the `POST /&#123;threads-user-id&#125;/threads_publish` endpoint when attempting to publish a media container. We recommend that your app also enforces the publishing rate limit, especially if your app allows app users to schedule posts to be published in the future.

To check a profile&#039;s current Threads API rate limit usage, query the [`GET /&#123;threads-user-id&#125;/threads_publishing_limit` endpoint](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/threads/reference/user#get---threads-user-id--threads-publishing-limit).

**Note:** This endpoint requires the `threads_basic` and `threads_content_publish` permissions.
