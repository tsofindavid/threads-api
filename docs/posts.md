You can use the Threads API to publish image, video, text, or carousel posts.

This document covers:

* [Single Thread Posts](#single-thread-posts)
* [Carousel Posts](#carousel-posts)
* [Topic Tags, Links, and GIFs](#topic-tags--links--and-gifs)
* [Media Specifications](#media-specifications)

## Single Thread Posts

Publishing a single image, video, or text post is a two-step process:

1. Create a media container with text only or with an image or video hosted on your public server with optional text using the `POST /&#123;threads-user-id&#125;/threads` endpoint.
2.  Publish the media container using the `POST /&#123;threads-user-id&#125;/threads_publish` endpoint.

### Limitations

* Text posts are limited to 500 characters.
* Emojis are counted as the [number of UTF-8 bytes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grapheme-splitter).

### Step 1: Create a Threads media container

Use the `POST /&#123;threads-user-id&#125;/threads` endpoint to create a Threads media container.

#### Parameters

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `is_carousel_item`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Boolean | **Required.**  &lt;br&gt;Indicates that images and/or videos will appear in a carousel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Values:** `true`, `false` (*default* for single thread posts) |
| `media_type`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;string | **Required.**  &lt;br&gt;Indicates the current media type.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Values:** `TEXT`, `IMAGE`, `VIDEO`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Note:** `CAROUSEL` is not available for single thread posts. |
| `image_url`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;URL | **Optional. Required for `media_type=IMAGE`.**  &lt;br&gt;The URL path to the image.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Note:** We will cURL your image using the URL provided so it must be on a public server. |
| `video_url`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;URL | **Optional. Required for `media_type=VIDEO`.**  &lt;br&gt;The URL path to the video.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Note:** We will cURL your video using the URL provided so it must be on a public server. |
| `text`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;string | **Optional. Required for `media_type=TEXT`.**  &lt;br&gt;The text associated with the post. If any URLs are included, the first URL in the `text` field will be used as the link preview for the post.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Note:** For the post character limit, emojis are counted as the [number of UTF-8 bytes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grapheme-splitter). |

Refer to the [`POST /&#123;threads-user-id&#125;/threads` endpoint reference](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/threads/reference/publishing#post---threads-user-id--threads) for additional supported parameters.

#### Example Request

```html
curl -i -X POST \
  -d &quot;media_type=IMAGE&quot; \
  -d &quot;image_url=&lt;IMAGE_URL&gt;&quot; \
  -d &quot;text=&lt;TEXT&gt;&quot; \
  -d &quot;access_token=&lt;ACCESS_TOKEN&gt;&quot; \
&quot;https://graph.threads.net/v1.0/&lt;THREADS_USER_ID&gt;/threads&quot;
```

#### Example Response

```json
&#123;
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;&lt;THREADS_MEDIA_CONTAINER_ID&gt;&quot;
&#125;
```

### Step 2: Publish the Threads media container

Use the `POST /&#123;threads-user-id&#125;/threads_publish` endpoint to publish the media container ID returned in the previous step.

It is recommended to wait on average 30 seconds before publishing a Threads media container to give our server enough time to fully process the upload. See the [media container status endpoint](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/threads/troubleshooting#publishing-does-not-return-a-media-id) for more details.

#### Parameters

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `creation_id`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;int | **Required.**  &lt;br&gt;The Threads media container ID. |

#### Example Request

```html
curl -i -X POST \
  -d &quot;creation_id=&lt;MEDIA_CONTAINER_ID&gt;&quot; \
  -d &quot;access_token=&lt;ACCESS_TOKEN&gt;&quot; \
&quot;https://graph.threads.net/v1.0/&lt;THREADS_USER_ID&gt;/threads_publish&quot;
```

#### Example Response

```json
&#123;
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;&lt;THREADS_MEDIA_ID&gt;&quot;
&#125;
```

## Carousel Posts

You may publish up to 20 images, videos, or a mix of the two in a carousel post. Publishing carousels is a three-step process:

1. Create the individual media containers for each image and video that should appear in the carousel using the `POST /&#123;threads-user-id&#125;/threads` endpoint.
2. Create a single carousel container to contain the media containers using the `POST /&#123;threads-user-id&#125;/threads` endpoint.
3. Publish the carousel container using the `POST /&#123;threads-user-id&#125;/threads_publish` endpoint.

**Note:** Carousel posts count as a single post against a profile&#039;s [rate limit](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/threads/overview#rate-limiting).

#### Limitations

* Carousels are limited to 20 images, videos, or a mix of the two.
* Carousels require a minimum  of two children.

### Step 1: Create an media container

Use the `POST /&#123;threads-user-id&#125;/threads` endpoint to create a media container for each of the images and/or videos that will appear in the carousel.

#### Parameters

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `is_carousel_item`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Boolean | **Required.**  &lt;br&gt;Indicates that images and/or videos will appear in a carousel when set to `true`.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Values:** `true`, `false` |
| `media_type`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;string | **Required.**  &lt;br&gt;Indicates the current media type.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Values:** `IMAGE`, `VIDEO`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Note:** `CAROUSEL` is not available for single thread posts. |
| `image_url`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;URL | **Optional. Required for `media_type=IMAGE`.**  &lt;br&gt;The URL path to the image.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Note:** We will cURL your image using the URL provided so it must be on a public server. |
| `video_url`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;URL | **Optional. Required for `media_type=VIDEO`.**  &lt;br&gt;The URL path to the video.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Note:** We will cURL your video using the URL provided so it must be on a public server. |
| `text`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;string | **Optional.**  &lt;br&gt;The text associated with the post. If any URLs are included, the first URL in the `text` field will be used as the link preview for the post.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Note:** For the post character limit, emojis are counted as the [number of UTF-8 bytes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grapheme-splitter). |

Refer to the [`POST /&#123;threads-user-id&#125;/threads` endpoint reference](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/threads/reference/publishing#post---threads-user-id--threads) for additional supported parameters.

#### Example Request

```html
curl -i -X POST \
  -d &quot;image_url=&lt;IMAGE_URL&gt;&quot; \
  -d &quot;is_carousel_item=true&quot; \
  -d &quot;access_token=&lt;ACCESS_TOKEN&gt;&quot; \
&quot;https://graph.threads.net/v1.0/&lt;THREADS_USER_ID&gt;/threads&quot;
```

#### Example Response

```json
&#123;
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;&lt;THREADS_MEDIA_CONTAINER_ID&gt;&quot;
&#125;
```

If the operation is successful, the API will return an media container ID, which can be used when creating the carousel container.

Repeat this process for each image and/or video that will appear in the carousel.

### Step 2: Create a carousel container

Use the `POST /&#123;threads-user-id&#125;/threads` endpoint to create a carousel container.

#### Parameters

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `media_type`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;string | **Required.**  &lt;br&gt;Indicates the current media type.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Value:** `CAROUSEL` |
| `children`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;list&lt;int&gt; | **Required.**  &lt;br&gt;A comma-separated list of the media container IDs of the images and/or videos that should appear in the published carousel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Note:** Carousels must have at least 2 and no more than 20 total images, videos, or a mix of the two. |
| `text`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;string | **Optional.**  &lt;br&gt;The text associated with the post. |

Refer to the [`POST /&#123;threads-user-id&#125;/threads` endpoint reference](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/threads/reference/publishing#post---threads-user-id--threads) for additional supported parameters.

#### Example Request

```html
curl -i -X POST \
  -d &quot;media_type=CAROUSEL&quot; \
  -d &quot;children=&lt;MEDIA_ID_1&gt;,&lt;MEDIA_ID_2&gt;,&lt;MEDIA_ID_3&gt;,...&quot; \
  -d &quot;access_token=&lt;ACCESS_TOKEN&gt;&quot; \
&quot;https://graph.threads.net/v1.0/&lt;THREADS_USER_ID&gt;/threads&quot;
```

#### Example Response

```json
&#123;
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;&lt;THREADS_CAROUSEL_CONTAINER_ID&gt;&quot;
&#125;
```

### Step 3: Publish the carousel container

Use the `POST /&#123;threads-user-id&#125;/threads_publish` endpoint to publish a carousel post.

**Note:** Profiles are limited to 250 published posts within a 24-hour period. Publishing a carousel counts as a single post.

#### Parameters

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `creation_id`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;int | **Required.**  &lt;br&gt;The Threads carousel container ID. |

#### Example Request

```html
curl -i -X POST \
  -d &quot;creation_id=&lt;MEDIA_CONTAINER_ID&gt;&quot; \
  -d &quot;access_token=&lt;ACCESS_TOKEN&gt;&quot; \
&quot;https://graph.threads.net/v1.0/&lt;THREADS_USER_ID&gt;/threads_publish&quot;
```

#### Example Response

```json
&#123;
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;&lt;THREADS_MEDIA_ID&gt;&quot;
&#125;
```

If the operation is successful, the API will return the carousel album&#039;s Threads media ID.

## Topic Tags, Links, and GIFs &#123;#topic-tags--links--and-gifs&#125;

Topics and links appear in posts in such a way as to encourage engagement.

### Topic Tags

Topics make posts more social by allowing central topics of discussion. You can include a topic in a post either by using the `topic_tag` parameter or by including a tag within the text of a post.

#### Using the `topic_tag` parameter

**Note:** Topic tags must be at least 1 character and no more than 50 characters long. The following characters are not allowed:

* Periods (.)
* Ampersands (&amp;)

##### Example request

```html
curl -i -X POST \
  -d &quot;media_type=TEXT&quot; \
  -d &quot;text=&lt;Text&gt;&quot; \
  -d &quot;access_token=&lt;ACCESS_TOKEN&gt;&quot; \
  -d &quot;topic_tag=&lt;TAG&gt;&quot; \
&quot;https://graph.threads.net/v1.0/&lt;THREADS_USER_ID&gt;/threads&quot;
```

#### Using an in-text topic tag

**Warning:** This method is not preferred but is kept for backwards compatability.

A topic can also be attached to a post by including it in-line within the text of the post. Only one topic tag is allowed per post, so the first valid tag included in a post of any type (text-only, image, video, carousel) via the API is treated as the tag for that post.

Information to keep in mind when adding a topic to a post using an in-text tag:

* Valid tags start with a hash sign (#).  
* The text is also configured in the app without the hash sign.
* Topic must be at least 1 character and no more than 50 characters long.
* Whole numbers that are preceded by a hash sign (i.e., #1) will not be converted into a tag. This is because it is assumed that # is signifying a number sign in this scenario.
* The following characters are not allowed when using in-text tags with the Threads API, so any in-text tag that starts with a hash sign will end just before these characters:

* Spaces, Tabs, New Line Characters
* Periods (.)
* Ampersands (&amp;)
* At Signs (&#064;)
* Exclamation Marks (!)
* Question Marks (?)
* Commas (,)
* Semi-Colons (;)
* Colons (:)

### Links

To attach a link to your post, use the `link_attachment` parameter when creating a media container.
If no `link_attachment` parameter is provided, then the first link made in a text-only post via the API is configured as the link attachment, which displays as a preview card, to make it easier to engage with and click on.

#### Limitations

* This feature is only available for text-only posts. It will not work with image, video, or carousel posts.
* The number of links is restricted to 5 or less.

**Warning:** Starting December 22, 2025, Threads posts containing more than 5 links will fail to post during the media creation step (`POST /&#123;threads-user-id&#125;/threads`) with the error code: `THREADS_API__LINK_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`.

How links are counted:

* All unique URLs found in the text field are counted as links.
* If the `link_attachment` field contains a URL that is different from all URLs in the text field, it is counted as an additional link.
* If the `link_attachment` URL is the same as any URL in the text field, it is only counted once, rather than twice.

Examples:

* If the `text` field contains only www.facebook.com, and the `link_attachment` is also www.facebook.com, this counts as 1 link.
* If the `text` field contains www.instagram.com and www.threads.com, and the `link_attachment` is www.facebook.com, this counts as 3 links.
* If the `text` field contains www.example.com, www.example.com, and www.test.com, and the `link_attachment`  is www.test.com, this counts as 2 links (www.example.com and www.test.com are each counted once).

If you receive this error, reduce the number of unique links in your post to 5 or less.

#### Publishing

Links can be attached when making an API call to the `POST /&#123;threads-user-id&#125;/threads` endpoint to [create a media container](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/threads/posts#step-1--create-a-threads-media-container).

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `link_attachment`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;URL | **Optional.**  &lt;br&gt;The URL that should be attached to a Threads post and displayed as a link preview. This must be a valid, publicly accessible URL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Note:** Can only be used for `media_type=TEXT` posts. |

##### Example Request

```html
curl -i -X POST \
  -d &quot;media_type=TEXT&quot; \
  -d &quot;text=&lt;TEXT&gt;&quot; \
  -d &quot;access_token=&lt;ACCESS_TOKEN&gt;&quot; \
  -d &quot;link_attachment=&lt;URL&gt; \
&quot;https://graph.threads.net/v1.0/&lt;THREADS_USER_ID&gt;/threads&quot;
```

##### Example Response

```json
&#123;
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;&lt;THREADS_MEDIA_CONTAINER_ID&gt;&quot;
&#125;
```

The request above creates a Threads media container that, once [published](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/threads/posts#step-2--publish-a-threads-media-container), will attach a link preview to your media.

#### Media Retrieval

The value for the `link_attachment` URL can be retrieved by making a request to the `GET /threads` or `GET /&#123;threads_media_id&#125;` endpoint to [retrieve media object(s)](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/threads/retrieve-and-discover-posts/retrieve-posts).

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `link_attachment_url`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;URL | The URL attached to a Threads post. |

##### Example Request

```html
curl -s -X GET \
&quot;https://graph.threads.net/v1.0/&lt;THREADS_MEDIA_ID&gt;?fields=id,link_attachment_url&amp;access_token=&lt;ACCESS_TOKEN&gt;&quot;
```

##### Example Response

```json
&#123;
   &quot;id&quot;: &quot;&lt;THREADS_MEDIA_ID&gt;&quot;,
   &quot;link_attachment_url&quot;: &quot;&lt;LINK_ATTACHMENT_URL&gt;&quot;,
&#125;
```

### GIFs

GIFs make posts more engaging by allowing users to express reactions, emotions, or ideas visually.

#### Limitations

* This feature is only available for text-only posts. It will not work on image, video, or carousel posts.
* [GIPHY](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api) is currently the only available GIF provider.

#### Publishing

GIFS can be attached when making an API call to the `POST /&#123;threads-user-id&#125;/threads` endpoint to [create a media container](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/threads/posts#step-1--create-a-threads-media-container).

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `gif_attachment`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;object | **Optional.**  &lt;br&gt;The ID and GIF provider for the GIF to attach to the post.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Fields:** `gif_id`, `provider` |

##### Example request

```html
curl -i -X POST \
  -d &quot;media_type=TEXT&quot; \
  -d &quot;text=&lt;Text&gt; \
  -d &quot;access_token=&lt;ACCESS_TOKEN&gt;&quot; \
  -d &quot;gif_attachment=&#123;&quot;gif_id&quot;:&quot;&lt;GIF_ID&gt;&quot;,&quot;provider&quot;:&quot;GIPHY&quot;&#125;&quot; \
&quot;https://graph.threads.net/v1.0/&lt;THREADS_USER_ID&gt;/threads&quot;
```

**Note:** The value of the `id` field you receive from the GIF provider’s API response should be used as the `&lt;GIF_ID&gt;` in the API call.

##### Example response

```json
&#123;
 &quot;id&quot;: &quot;&lt;THREADS_MEDIA_ID&gt;&quot;
&#125;
```

The request above creates a Threads media container that, once [published](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/threads/posts#step-2--publish-a-threads-media-container), will attach a GIF to your media.
